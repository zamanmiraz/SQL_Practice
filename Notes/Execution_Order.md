# SQL Query Execution Order

Understanding the order of execution in SQL queries is crucial for writing efficient and accurate queries. SQL queries are processed in a specific sequence to ensure the correct retrieval and manipulation of data. Below is the typical order of execution for SQL queries:

1. **FROM/JOIN**  
   The execution starts with the `FROM` clause, which identifies the table(s) involved in the query. If there are `JOIN` clauses, they are processed first to combine rows from different tables based on specified conditions.

2. **WHERE**  
   After the tables are identified and joined, the `WHERE` clause is executed to filter rows based on specified conditions. This reduces the number of rows that need to be processed in subsequent steps.

3. **GROUP BY**  
   If the query includes a `GROUP BY` clause, it is executed next. This clause groups the data based on the values in one or more columns, which is essential for performing aggregate functions.

4. **HAVING**  
   The `HAVING` clause is evaluated after `GROUP BY`. It filters the grouped records based on specified conditions, similar to the `WHERE` clause but applied to groups.

5. **SELECT**  
   The `SELECT` clause is executed next. It determines which columns and expressions to include in the final result set. This is where computations and aliasing occur.

6. **DISTINCT**  
   If the `DISTINCT` keyword is used, it is applied after the `SELECT` clause to remove duplicate rows from the result set.

7. **ORDER BY**  
   The `ORDER BY` clause is executed to sort the result set based on specified columns, either in ascending or descending order.

8. **LIMIT/OFFSET**  
   Finally, the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses are applied to restrict the number of rows returned by the query. This is useful for pagination and reducing the result set size.

# SQL Query Execution Order Mnemonic

To remember the SQL query execution order, use the mnemonic:

**"Funky Wizards Grab Happy Sandwiches During Outdoor Lunches"**

## Execution Order Breakdown:

1. **Funky** → `FROM`/`JOIN`  
   - Identify the tables and combine them if necessary.

2. **Wizards** → `WHERE`  
   - Filter rows based on conditions.

3. **Grab** → `GROUP BY`  
   - Group data for aggregation.

4. **Happy** → `HAVING`  
   - Filter groups based on aggregate conditions.

5. **Sandwiches** → `SELECT`  
   - Choose the columns or expressions for the result set.

6. **During** → `DISTINCT`  
   - Remove duplicate rows.

7. **Outdoor** → `ORDER BY`  
   - Sort the result set.

8. **Lunches** → `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`  
   - Restrict the number of rows in the result.

By associating each clause with a word, you can easily recall the correct SQL query execution order.
